# Tracking Crypto Currency

This application is my first experience and practice with using APIs.

I used this public API in order to get current and updating crypto currency prices and put them on a web page where they constantly update. 

I believe I learned a decent amount regarding how APIs work and why they are important. This is a concept that up until this little mini project I had trouble understanding but once I had that 'click' moment, my mind was absolutely blown.
